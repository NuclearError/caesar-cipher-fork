# Caesar Cipher No. 2 - this time with boilerplate!

I made a daft mistake with reading the test brief - I got so excited by the first part that I totally overlooked the "please fork this repo" instruction at the end! [Thus, I built my own vanilla typescript project from scratch using lite-server.](https://github.com/NuclearError/caesar-cipher)

When I realised the mistake, I transferred the work over to the React fork as required by the brief. The readme for the original project gives an overview of the amount of time I spent on this project. Transferring over to the fork probably took approximately 20 minutes.

# The Bots Frontend coding challenge

For this challenge we would like you to create a [Caeser Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). You will create an input, which will take any string and apply the cipher, then display the results below.

## The Spec

- Create a form which takes a string input, and outputs the string with the cipher applied
- Add a form element to set if the cipher is applied forwards or backwards
- Numbers & special characters should be ignored

## Getting started

- Open a terminal and run \`npm run dev\`
- A second terminal can be opened to run tests: \`npm run test\`

## Considerations

- No libraries please
- Please provide the solution with tests & types
- Expected time should be 1 hour

Please fork this repo and send us a link to your solution. Good luck!
